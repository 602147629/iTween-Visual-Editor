	"description": "The iTween Visual Editor is a Unity 3, editor component that allows you to set up almost any iTween tween visually vs requiring code. So you can replace this\n\niTween.MoveTo(gameObject,{\"x\":10,\"time\":4,\"looptype\":\"loop\"});\n\nwith a nice Unity inspector view.\n\nFor more information and an example project please visit the <a href=\"http://dkoontz.wordpress.com/itween-visual-editor/\">project page</a>.",
	"changes": "Added iTween menu item to move files into the correct position for Javascript based projects.  Fixed bug with delay of 0 seconds still pausing slightly before beginning tween. Changed visual path editor selection list to use global listing instead of just paths attached to the same GameObject.",
